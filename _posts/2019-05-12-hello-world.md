"With new domain comes with new website" (Peter Parker, 2012). **#truestory**

So recently, I just received an email that my previous domain `fadzil.win` has expired (so sad LOL). Suddenly, this idea just came to my mind over the _`nothing to do`_ weekand. _"Why not I just buy (LOL i'm not paying for it though) new domain and recreate myself"_. Sort of like new year resolution kind of thing but its May already but whatever Im bored.


### What I've planned to share inside my blog?
* What I've learned
* What I've not learned
* References which I think were good
* My life (most probably no)


```js
// Code Snippet!
let message = "Hello World!";
console.log(message);
```

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/it-works.png)

Btw if you're developer and want to write blog but too lazy to do coding, go checkout this open source [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub for more details. It's easy as just updating `markdown file` for your blog posts. I also did the same thing ðŸ˜Š.

P/S: Apologize for my bad english!
